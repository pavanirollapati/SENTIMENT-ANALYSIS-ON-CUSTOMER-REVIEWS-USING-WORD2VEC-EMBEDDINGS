# SENTIMENT-ANALYSIS-ON-CUSTOMER-REVIEWS-USING-WORD2VEC-EMBEDDINGS
Sentiment analysis on customer reviews using Word2Vec embeddings involves converting text into numerical vectors that capture word meanings based on context. By applying Word2Vec, the model learns semantic relationships between words. This allows for accurate classification of customer feedback into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments.

1. Data Collection
Gathered a diverse and representative dataset of customer reviews.
This involves collecting customer reviews from various sources like e-commerce platforms (Amazon, eBay), social media (Twitter, Facebook), or customer feedback forms. Data can be obtained through APIs, web scraping, or pre-existing datasets. The dataset should be large enough to train the model effectively and contain varied sentiments (positive, negative, neutral).

2. Data Preprocessing
Prepared the collected text data for analysis.
The preprocessing step is crucial to ensure the data is clean and structured for machine learning models:
Text Cleaning: Removed unwanted characters such as special symbols, extra spaces, and irrelevant punctuation.
Lowercasing: Converted all text to lowercase to maintain uniformity (e.g., "Great" and "great" should be treated the same).
Stopword Removal: Removed common words (such as "the", "is", "and") that don’t contribute to the sentiment analysis.
Tokenization: Splitted the text into individual words (tokens) for analysis. This is a critical step before converting the text into vector representations.
Handling Missing Data: If there are any missing reviews or empty entries, they should either be removed or replaced.
Lemmatization or Stemming: Reduceed words to their root form (e.g., "running" to "run"), which helps improve model performance by reducing redundancy.

3. Text Vectorization using Word2Vec
Converted text into numerical vectors that the model can process.
Word2Vec Embeddings: This step involves training or using pre-trained Word2Vec embeddings to represent words as vectors. Word2Vec creates dense vector representations of words by considering their context in the dataset.
The algorithm captures semantic relationships (e.g., "king" - "man" + "woman" = "queen") by analyzing large amounts of text data.
These vectors help the model understand the meaning of words in relation to others, improving sentiment classification accuracy.
Pre-trained Word2Vec Models: If training a Word2Vec model from scratch is not feasible, we can use pre-trained models like Google's Word2Vec or GloVe, which have been trained on large corpora like Google News or Wikipedia.

4. Model Selection
Choosed an appropriate machine learning or deep learning model to classify the sentiment.
Based on the Word2Vec embeddings, we can use various machine learning algorithms or deep learning models:
Machine Learning Models: Simple models like Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), or Random Forest can be effective, particularly with small to medium-sized datasets.
Deep Learning Models: If we have a large dataset, a deep learning model like a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) or Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) can be more powerful for sentiment analysis. These models are capable of handling sequential data and capturing long-term dependencies in the text.
Transformers (Optional): we could also consider transformer-based models like BERT, which have become very popular in natural language processing (NLP) for their superior ability to capture complex contextual information.

5. Model Training
Trained the selected model using the prepared dataset.
The model is trained on the vectorized data (from Word2Vec) and its corresponding sentiment labels (positive, negative, or neutral).
The training phase involves adjusting model parameters to minimize the error in sentiment classification, using an optimization algorithm (e.g., gradient descent).
Hyperparameter Tuning: Tune hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, number of epochs, and network architecture to ensure optimal performance. Techniques like grid search or random search can be used for hyperparameter tuning.
The model learns from the patterns in the data, like specific words or phrases that indicate sentiment (e.g., "amazing" or "terrible").

6. Model Evaluation
Assessed the model’s performance to ensure it’s correctly classifying sentiment.
After training, the model is evaluated on a separate test dataset (data not seen by the model during training).
Common evaluation metrics include:
Accuracy: Percentage of correctly classified reviews.
Precision: How many of the reviews classified as positive/negative were actually correct.
Recall: How many of the actual positive/negative reviews were correctly identified by the model.
F1-Score: A combined metric that balances precision and recall.
Confusion Matrix: A matrix showing the true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives, helping you understand where the model is making errors.
If the performance isn’t satisfactory, we can adjust the model or retrain with more data.

7. Sentiment Classification
Used the trained model to classify new, unseen customer reviews.
Once the model is trained and evaluated, it can be deployed to classify new customer reviews into sentiment categories (positive, negative, or neutral).
The model predicts sentiment by analyzing the Word2Vec vector representations of new reviews and comparing them to the learned patterns.
These classifications help businesses understand customer satisfaction levels in real-time.

8. Analysis & Visualization
Visualized and interpreted sentiment patterns to derive actionable insights.
Sentiment Distribution: Created pie charts, bar graphs, or histograms to show the distribution of positive, negative, and neutral sentiments across customer reviews.
Trends Over Time: Tracked sentiment trends over time (e.g., by days, weeks, or months) to see how customer sentiment evolves.
Word Clouds: Generated word clouds to highlight frequent terms associated with positive or negative sentiments.
Topic Modeling: Used techniques like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to identify the most common themes or topics in customer reviews.
These visualizations help businesses pinpoint areas of improvement or identify key drivers of customer satisfaction.

9. Deployment
Implemented the sentiment analysis system in a real-time environment.
The trained model can be integrated into customer service platforms, product review systems, or social media monitoring tools.
It can be deployed as an API to analyze incoming customer feedback in real-time, providing businesses with instant insights into customer sentiments.
The deployment may also involve setting up automated workflows to trigger actions (e.g., flagging negative reviews for follow-up).

10. Monitoring & Maintenance
Ensured the model continues to perform well over time.
Performance Monitoring: Continuously monitored the model’s performance to ensure it’s still accurately classifying sentiment, especially as new data comes in.
Model Retraining: As language evolves and new patterns emerge, the model might require retraining with new data to adapt to these changes.
Feedback Loop: Collected feedback from real-world usage to refine and improve the model’s accuracy and relevance over time.
